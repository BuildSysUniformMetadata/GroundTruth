# GroundTruth
Generate Ground Truth Data for one building in each campus, capturing all different types of sensors and relationships

Two pieces of information required per volunteering Research Group :

1. all sensors in a buildings, how to parse the metadata of those sensors, and a file capturing every relationship within that building (e.g which temp sensor is connected to which setpoint, which VAVs are part of which AHU, etc).
2. a file describing the extent to which the building's sensors can be represented in haystack.

# Demos

This is a selection of demos developed to gain an understanding of different RDF features and present limitations as they were discovered.

These demos were written as needs arose and may not all be equally relevant for the new audience. They should probably be replaced by another suite designed based on what is useful.

Previously they were placed at the GTC location, but I moved them here as they were not specific to this building. As I am not sure where they should end up (or if we want them at all), I haven't bothered updating the paths and thus they won't work.

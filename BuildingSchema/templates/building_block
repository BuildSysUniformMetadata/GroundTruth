# Regarding the Heat Exchanger example:
# =====================================
#
# The Heat_Exchanger_Functional_Block instance will apply the following relationships:
# - any Heat_Exchanger_Primary_Input which 'isPartOf' the instance will 'feed' to any
#   Heat_Exchanger_*_Output of the same instance
# - any Heat_Exchanger_Secondary_Input which 'isPartOf' the instance will 'feed' to any
#   Heat_Exchanger_*_Output of the same instance
# 
# It would be nice to only have a 'feeds(temperature)' relationship between the two
# sides instead of the vaguely defined 'feeds' that we currently use.
